It is closing time at the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs receives a phone
call ordering a pizza. Despite the fact that the Krusty Krab neither
serves pizza nor makes deliveries, Mr. Krabs creates a pizza from
Krabby Patties and has Squidward and SpongeBob deliver it, much to
Squidward's dismay.

Outside, Squidward tells SpongeBob to start their boat. However,
SpongeBob notes he is still in boating school, but Squidward (being
lazy) tells SpongeBob it was just around the corner. SpongeBob
nervously begins "backing up", exhausting the entire gas tank, leaving
them stuck in the middle of nowhere. Squidward kicks the boat in
anger, and it instantly jump-starts and drives away without them.
SpongeBob suggests they deliver the pizza on foot, and so they start
walking. Along the way, SpongeBob sings a song about the Krusty Krab
Pizza, and how it is the best pizza on the sea floor. When they see a
truck, SpongeBob attempts to catch a ride by hitchhiking like the
"pioneers", but fails and is almost hit by the truck. Soon after, they
enter strong winds, where Squidward tries to take the pizza from
SpongeBob. While they struggle, the winds carry them into a tornado,
which spits them out, sending them flying into the distance. When they
land, the road is nowhere in sight, and Squidward concludes that they
have become hopelessly lost. SpongeBob sees a moss-covered rock, and
says that, according to the pioneers, moss always points to
civilization. However, Squidward insists on going in the opposite
direction, and SpongeBob follows. The screen then pans away to reveal
that the moss indeed pointed towards the city
