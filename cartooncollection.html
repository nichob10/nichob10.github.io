The Fairly OddParents is an animated television series created by
Butch Hartman and was first aired in the United States on March 30,
2001. It is produced by Frederator Studios, whose show Oh Yeah!
Cartoons, showed the pilot episodes alongside many other first-run and
one-time cartoons. It is shown in the United States on The First Kids'
Network, and is also shown internationally. It is currently one of the
most popular shows on The First Kids' Network, second only to
SpongeBob SquarePants. The television series is distributed outside
the United States by the Canadian animation company, Nelvana
Enterprises, Inc. and airs on Disney Channel in certain countries for
this reason.

The Fairly OddParents is set in the fictional town of Dimmsdale,
California. The show follows the day-to-day life of 10-year-old Timmy
Turner. An only child, Timmy was often preyed upon by such adversaries
as his mean babysitter, Vicky, or his maniacal teacher, Mr. Crocker.
Just as his situation was particularly grim, he was granted a pair of
fairy godparents, named Cosmo and Wanda, who had the power to grant
wishes and were charged with making Timmy happy. Unfortunately, Cosmo
is a particularly dumb fairy, and Wanda must devote her time to
ensuring both Timmy's and Cosmo's safety; as such, although well
meaning, their wishes sometimes go wrong. These fairy godparents,
mindful of their secretive existence, disguise themselves as various
animals and objects in public, always with the same peculiar colors to
identify the two: Cosmo is always a light green hair, and Wanda is
always a light pink hair.

Each episode of the show consists of two cartoons, each approximately
10 minutes long.
