		<div class="fopdescription">The Fairly OddParents is an animated television series created by
		Butch Hartman and was first aired in the United States on March 30,
		2001. It is produced by Frederator Studios, whose show Oh Yeah!
		Cartoons, showed the pilot episodes alongside many other first-run and
		one-time cartoons. It is shown in the United States on The First Kids'
		Network, and is also shown internationally. It is currently one of the
		most popular shows on The First Kids' Network, second only to
		SpongeBob SquarePants. The television series is distributed outside
		the United States by the Canadian animation company, Nelvana
		Enterprises, Inc. and airs on Disney Channel in certain countries for
		this reason.

		The Fairly OddParents is set in the fictional town of Dimmsdale,
		California. The show follows the day-to-day life of 10-year-old Timmy
		Turner. An only child, Timmy was often preyed upon by such adversaries
		as his mean babysitter, Vicky, or his maniacal teacher, Mr. Crocker.
		Just as his situation was particularly grim, he was granted a pair of
		fairy godparents, named Cosmo and Wanda, who had the power to grant
		wishes and were charged with making Timmy happy. Unfortunately, Cosmo
		is a particularly dumb fairy, and Wanda must devote her time to
		ensuring both Timmy's and Cosmo's safety; as such, although well
		meaning, their wishes sometimes go wrong. These fairy godparents,
		mindful of their secretive existence, disguise themselves as various
		animals and objects in public, always with the same peculiar colors to
		identify the two: Cosmo is always a light green hair, and Wanda is
		always a light pink hair.

		Each episode of the show consists of two cartoons, each approximately
		10 minutes long.</div>

		<div class="izdescription">Invader Zim is an American animated television series created by Jhonen Vasquez for Nickelodeon. The series centers on an extraterrestrial named Zim, from the planet Irk, and his mission to conquer Earth and enslave the human race along with his malfunctioning robot servant GIR.</div>

		<div class="rmdescription">After going missing for nearly 20 years, Rick Sanchez suddenly arrives at his daughter Beths doorstep looking to move in with her and her family. Beth welcomes him with open arms, but her unremarkable husband Jerry isnt too thrilled about the tearful reunion as Ricks arrival serves to shake things up quite a bit around the household. Rick converts the garage into his personal laboratory and gets to work on all sorts of dangerous sci-fi gadgets and contraptions. That wouldnt be so bad if not for the fact that Rick continues to involve his grandchildren Morty and Summer in his insane adventures.

		With the exception of the Pilot episode, each episode ends with a post-credits scene.</div>
