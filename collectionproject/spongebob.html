    <div class="sbvid1description">It is closing time at the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs receives a phone
	call ordering a pizza. Despite the fact that the Krusty Krab neither
	serves pizza nor makes deliveries, Mr. Krabs creates a pizza from
	Krabby Patties and has Squidward and SpongeBob deliver it, much to
	Squidward's dismay.

	Outside, Squidward tells SpongeBob to start their boat. However,
	SpongeBob notes he is still in boating school, but Squidward (being
	lazy) tells SpongeBob it was just around the corner. SpongeBob
	nervously begins "backing up", exhausting the entire gas tank, leaving
	them stuck in the middle of nowhere. Squidward kicks the boat in
	anger, and it instantly jump-starts and drives away without them.
	SpongeBob suggests they deliver the pizza on foot, and so they start
	walking. Along the way, SpongeBob sings a song about the Krusty Krab
	Pizza, and how it is the best pizza on the sea floor. When they see a
	truck, SpongeBob attempts to catch a ride by hitchhiking like the
	"pioneers", but fails and is almost hit by the truck. Soon after, they
	enter strong winds, where Squidward tries to take the pizza from
	SpongeBob. While they struggle, the winds carry them into a tornado,
	which spits them out, sending them flying into the distance. When they
	land, the road is nowhere in sight, and Squidward concludes that they
	have become hopelessly lost. SpongeBob sees a moss-covered rock, and
	says that, according to the pioneers, moss always points to
	civilization. However, Squidward insists on going in the opposite
	direction, and SpongeBob follows. The screen then pans away to reveal
	that the moss indeed pointed towards the city.</div>

    	<div class="sbvid2description">The Narrator introduces Goo Lagoon, a popular beach in Bikini Bottom,
		where SpongeBob and Sandy are playing. SpongeBob puts on a show by
		making sand sculptures such as him covering himself in sand and
		calling himself, "Sandy.", acting like Squidward, and as Vito who
		says, "Here's an order of 25 Sand Pizza's, which makes Sandy laugh.
		Larry the Lobster comes and asks if they want to lift weights, which
		Sandy quickly accepts, while SpongeBob mopes behind them. When they
		arrive at the weight lifting area, Sandy lifts a bar weight and the
		crowd cheers. SpongeBob tries to get them to do something else, but
		Larry continues. He lifts a bar weight with six weights and the crowd
		cheers. Attempting to impress the crowd, SpongeBob lifts a stick but
		the crowd falls asleep. Sandy then lifts two anchors and is cheered.
		Larry then lifts the entire audience and bleachers, and once again the
		crowd cheers.SpongeBob is left out, and tries to get more attention by
		lifting a stick with Stay Puft marshmallow men on the ends, which he
		actually struggles to do. However, he accidentally rips his pants in
		the process, and the crowd laughs hysterically. Feeling embarrassed,
		SpongeBob sadly leaves the weight lifting area, as the people continue
		to laugh at him, until one fish compliments him for the good laugh.
		When Sandy agrees, SpongeBob decides to use this to his advantage. He
		rips his pants again while playing volleyball, then while playing
		frisbee. SpongeBob and Sandy then proceed to get some ice cream, where
		he again uses his ripped pants joke and the Banana Splits came in
		playing their theme song. He gets carried away and uses the joke at
		the snack bar and a kitchen. While at the surfing competition,
		SpongeBob rips his pants while surfing, which bores everyone.
		Realizing this, SpongeBob pretends to drown. When he washes up on the
		beach, a crowd gathers around him. He tells the lifeguard that he
		needs a tailor, because he ripped his pants. Everyone gets upset and
		leaves, including Sandy. He attempts to revive the joke by ripping his
		entire pants off, but it fails. After he realizes that he has driven
		all his friends away, he asks himself if he is the biggest loser on
		the beach. This question is answered by three other beachers, who each
		believe they are the biggest losers on the beach: Murray who forgot to
		put on sunscreen, Dexter who got sand in his burger machine, and Don
		Music who was buried in the sand and forgotten. They ask SpongeBob
		what happened to him, and he tells his story through a song. Everyone
		on the beach hears his song, and understands how he feels and that he
		apologizes. Sandy tells SpongeBob that if he wanted her to be his
		friend, he should have been himself. Larry asks him to sign his pants,
		and SpongeBob accepts. He bends down to sign, but his underwear rips
		off completely, and SpongeBob blushes in embarrassment.

    	<div class="sbvid3description">Squidward looks forward to a weekend of peace and quiet when SpongeBob
and Patrick decide to go camping. However, he's disappointed to learn
that they decided to camp in SpongeBob's front yard, right outside his
window.

Squidward decides to camp too, after he mistakenly gets the impression
that SpongeBob and Patrick think he's somehow not manly or qualified
enough to camp (SpongeBob's comment of "Have fun inside" caused
Squidward to camp with them). After he's unable to set up his
automated tent, he decides to sleep on the ground.

Then Spongebob and Patrick eat marshmellows while Squidward goes to
his house to get his can opener. However, he was stopped by them
saying that it just doesn't feel right. So Squidward eats the
marshmellow getting hit by Patrick's burned ones. Spongebob then plays
a song abouting Camping. Squidward disliked it so he plays his
clarinet really badly and SpongeBob stops him by shooting a
marshmallow in his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick start talking about
sea-bears and the things that attract it. Squidward attempts to
disprove their existence by doing all the things that supposedly would
attract a sea-bear, such as cheese cubes, hoop skirts, flashlights
(natural prey, affirms Patrick), clown shoes, et cetera. Sure enough,
he is eventually attacked. SpongeBob and Patrick make an 'anti
sea-bear circle', of which Squidward is also skeptical. After being
attacked several times, he attempts to make a circle, but it's
actually an oval which offers no protection. He jumps into SpongeBob
and Patrick's circle where he is not attacked. Unfortunately, a
sea-rhinoceros, which is attracted by the sound of the sea-bear
attacks, appears and grunts at Squidward, who is not wearing his anti
sea-rhinoceros undergarments.
