    <div class="fopvid1description">Mr. Turner and Mrs. Turner 		find themselves so tired and busy that they
		don't have time for anything but working and sleeping. Frustrated with
		not getting any quality time with his parents, Timmy wishes the two
		had super powers like that of his hero "The Crimson Chin". The next
		morning, the Turner parents wake up to find they are super heroes and
		after finishing they're work day in five minutes, spend the morning
		talking to Timmy. After he leaves for school, they decide to use their
		powers to fight crime and take on the identities of Mighty Mom and
		Dyno Dad. With his parents working as full-time heroes, Timmy finds
		they have even less time to spend with him causing him to be stuck
		with Vicky and upon wishing for them to return to normal, Cosmo and
		Wanda inform him that they are so powerful, they are impervious to
		magic. Timmy finds out that he needs to get his parents to give up
		their powers so he could get them back to normal, so he then wishes he
		was "Galactimus the Eater of Planets" and faces off against his
		parents. Using a pull string doll of himself, he convinces the two
		that their son is in danger and they agree to give up their powers.
		With Mr. and Mrs. Turner back to normal, Timmy wishes up a picnic on
		the outskirts of town and the Turners then start enjoying the picnic
		that Timmy wished up. Unbeknownst to them, Dimmsdale is being
		destroyed behind them by various things like monsters and natural
		disasters.

		Yugopotamians see the humans celebrating Halloween, and fearing an

    	<div class="fopvid3description">On the morning of Timmy's birthday, his alarm awakens him with a
		broadcast about today being a special day because it was Chip
		Skylark's concert. One of the singer's hit songs, "My Shiny Teeth and
		Me", begins to play on the radio. Cosmo and Wanda appear in full Chip
		Skylark fan garb and start dancing to the beat, Cosmo also mentions
		that he once played the "electric triangle". Timmy is frustrated,
		because everyone is forgetting that today was his birthday, they were
		more concerned over Chip Skylark's concert. Expecting better from his
		parents, Timmy is surprised to learn that they too are attending
		Chip's concert, and leaving him in the care of Vicky. Timmy's parents
		leave her a lot of money so that she and Timmy could watch Chip on
		pay-per-view, and then leave for the concert. Not long after, Vicky
		sends Timmy to his room so she could enjoy the concert by herself.
