    <div class="izvid1description">Parent-Teacher Night is approaching and Zim is confronted with the fact that he doesn't have any parents (Irkens are cloned from a gene bank). He makes use of his robot parents to attempt to fool the students, teachers and parents. However, Zim knows that the Roboparents aren't equipped for such a job. Dib, who brings his dad's communication device, tries to prove that Zim is an alien. The robotic parents malfunction and wreak havoc during the meeting, but nobody discovers that they aren't human or that Zim is an extraterrestrial.

	Zim goes on an outing to the downtown area in order to test a new guidance chip he installed in GIR, but when GIR removes the chip before leaving to store a cupcake, Zim and GIR are left lost and have to resort to public transport to find their way back. Their journey home is complicated further by Zim temporarily losing his vision by looking at the sun, his disguise being mistaken for that of a bank robber, and his escape from the police being wrecked by GIR replacing his extra rocket fuel with tuna fish.

    	<div class="izvid2description">Dib is doing experiments with his father's equipment until it goes wrong. Dib manages to launch a portal into a monster world in his forehead. Dib now starts passing in and out of an alternate dimension where everything is evil. He manages to force Zim to come into the dimension with him. The monsters capture Zim and say they won't release him if Dib doesn't "surrender his head." It is revealed that Dib's head is the only portal out of the dimension, and all the evil creatures within it want to go through it. Zim saves Dib so that he can get through the portal but he then leaves Dib to the monsters. The monsters have a look through the portal but turn back as they are disgusted by the sight of GIR eating candy.

    	<div class="izvid3description">Zim sees a B-rated movie reminiscent of the 1953 film version The War of the Worlds, where advanced extraterrestrial species are thwarted by common germs. Zim becomes acutely germophobic and dedicates himself to studying and exterminating all of the Earth's bacteria. He embarks on incredibly thorough cleaning sprees and uses germ spray on himself and GIR. After running out of germ spray he heads out to buy more, but GIR runs off to MacMeatie's, (parody of McDonald's). There Zim discovers that he can protect himself from germs using a germ-resistant hamburger "meat" made of recycled napkins, which is sold there.

		When a pigeon lands on Zim's head in class, he is sent to the nurse's office for having 'head pigeons', but he becomes concerned that the nurse may discover that he is not actually human. To avoid this, Zim steals human organs from other children and replaces them with other objects and ingests them himself, resulting in him having multiple hearts and spleens. When Dib notices Zim had been out of class for a long time, he discovers Zim and what he had been doing and tries to stop him. In the end, Zim passes his examination, and after it is discovered that Zim had swapped a mooing can toy into Dib's body, he is immediately dubbed inhuman by the nurse, and is dubbed a "hideous mooing cyborg boy" in a resulting newspaper article.
